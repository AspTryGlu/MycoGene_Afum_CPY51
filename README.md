# MycoGene: A workflow for extracting specific gene sequences from WGS Illumina paired-end short reads

# Description

## Inputs:
1. `samples-paths.txt`, Plain text file that contains the samples name and paths for raw reads, separated by `:`. One sample per row, no header.  
Example:
   ```
   Sample1:/my-path/sample1_R1.fastq.gz:/my-path/sample1_R2.fastq.gz  
   Sample2:/my-path/sample2_R1.fastq.gz:/my-path/sample2_R2.fastq.gz
   ```

2. `query_seq.fasta`, Fasta file that contains nucleotide sequence of the gene CYP51 (AF338659).
3. `query_aa.fasta`, Fasta file that contains aminoacid sequence of the protein CYP51(AAK73659).

## Outputs:
1. `aln_gene_output.fasta`, Fasta file that contains aligned nucleotide sequence of the gene of interest for all samples.
2. `aln_protein_output.fasta`, Fasta file that contains aligned aminoacid sequence of the protein of interest for all samples.
3. `aln_wnoncoding_gene_output.fasta`, Fasta file that contains aligned nucleotide sequence of the gene of interest plus a 500 nucleotides upstream of the coding gene for all samples.Upstream region include the gene promotor for identifing the tandem repeats (TR34, TR46)
4. `QC_report.txt`, Tabular text file with blastn hits information.
<br/><br/>
**Note**: Review QC report for the following quality metrics:

   | QC Metric                       | Threshold                           |
   | ------------------------------- |-------------------------------------|
   | Percentage of identity (pident) | > 95 %                              |
   | Length                          | Similar to the query sequence length|

5. MycoGen_Afum_CYP51 generates three additional outputs, HTML files with the vusualization for: 
   1) `data_gene_aln.html`, gene alignment
   2) `data_upstream-CPY51_aln.html`, 500 nucleotides upstrean and gene sequenced aligned, for identifing the tandem repeats (TR34, TR46)
   3) `data_protein_aln.html`,protein alignment colored by mismatches in red and 4-nucleotides motifs in green where last higtligthed 
   aminoacid is a common mutation associated to azoles resistance (G54X, L98H,Y121F,G138X, P216X, F219X, M220X, T289A, Y431X, G448X).

## Requirements
- FaQCs (https://github.com/LANL-Bioinformatics/FaQCs)
- SPAdes (https://github.com/ablab/spades)  
- blast (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK569861/)  
- samtools (https://bioconda.github.io/recipes/samtools/README.html)    
- Clustal omega (https://github.com/GSLBiotech/clustal-omega)  
- mView (https://sourceforge.net/projects/bio-mview/files/bio-mview)
  
## Running MycoGene
1. Ensure your inputs are placed in the same directory as the MycoGen_Afum_CYP51.sh script.
2. `nohup bash MycoGen_Afum_CYP51.sh`

# Workflow
![Flowchart]( ./images/flowchart_MycoGene.png)

# Roadmap
Some potential enhancements and use cases:
1. Use multiples genes of interest as query. Potential use for specie identification with more than one marker. Ex. Genes TEF1, rDNA, RPB2 for Fusarium species identification.
2. To add BLAST type as a user selection parameter (tblastn or blastn), to perform the analysis using a nucleotide sequence as query. Potential use for recovering noncoding sequence region. Ex. Promotor sequence and tandem repeats for CYP51 gene for Aspergillus.
